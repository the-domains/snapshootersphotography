About

SnapShooters Photography was started by us (Gaurav Nawathey & Pratik Lotlikar) in late 2015\. We both took up Wedding Photography as it was one of best ways to showcase our skills & we both love exploring new places, new cultures, meeting new people, making new friends with lots of good food, laughter and conversations.

Over the last 6 months, we have added another 3 members to our team who are full time professionally trained photographers. We are geared up to handle fairly large weddings which require multiple photographers & cinematographers as well as small intimate affairs or family events which requires a photographer or two.

We follow a simple philosophy where we click everything for a particular wedding with a mix of Candid shots, Traditional shots and fun posed shots; we even love to shoot the surroundings, makeups , the family dramas, certain intimate moments, hidden glances & public display of affection ;)
